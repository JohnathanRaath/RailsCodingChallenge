Application Name: Challenge

Author: Johnathan Raath

Description: A lightweight, user-friendly program that provides users with a library that houses all of the books that they add.

Further information: This was the first Ruby program I had ever coded, and was surprised at how efficient and easy-to-use the language was. There were a few hiccoughs along the way, namely figuring out where I had to put the differing languages of code, and what commands I needed to run in the terminal, but upon repeating the process a few times, it became a lot more fluid to use.
